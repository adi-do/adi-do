ðŸ‘‹ Hello. How can I help you?

This is my default answer on the internal chat of the company I work for. Solving problems and explaining the solution in simple words, using common life metaphors is what brought me aceptance and authoritative presence.
I pretend using these skills here, trying to explain complex things in beginner's language.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building up my network an security skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning micro services with Kubernetes.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriandogar/
